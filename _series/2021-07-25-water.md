**Water** can be freedom, ease, calm.\
Floating, weightlessness, serenity.\
Murky peril, the deep unknown, waves crashing against slimy rocks.

In recent months, there has been no sense of ease, no floating. I guess I created it myself: an oasis of cutting and arranging, dripping and dropping elements on top of one another, leaving them, coming back, rearranging, glue marks, ‘a-ha!’ moments, accidentally pushing something off the desk with my elbow and realising that it looks better on top of the image it fell on.

I focused on the existence of **water** in natural spaces rather than the bedside glass. On the waves for both their unrepeatable patterns and mesmerising repetitiveness. On the open space, deafening waterfalls and translucent colours.

When passing a lake, I often want to jump in and change my mind at the last moment, plunging into fear, not liquid. I think, perhaps, next time I will.
