Joana is a Liverpool-based artist with more energy than a honey bee in the middle of the summer. Her creativity is a powerful force and paired with a critical eye, the resulting work is memorable to say the least. We caught up in her loft appartment/ studio, surrounded by piles of large-scale canvases and lush plants in the evening light.
