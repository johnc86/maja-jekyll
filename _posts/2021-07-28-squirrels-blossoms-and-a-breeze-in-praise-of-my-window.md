We know what’s happening – there’s a pandemic, we all have to stay home to keep ourselves and others safe, so I will spare you and myself the lengthy intros that writers seem to love recently, even though we’re all living through the same terrifying and strange time in history. I’ll get straight to it – I am incredibly grateful for my living room window. Daily nature observation has become the highlight of my day, every day.
