Gabriella Warren-Smith is a Liverpool-based curator on a mission to find out how new technology, or more specifically, handheld devices are affecting how we perceive art and, more broadly, how they they touch our lives (and brains). Over the past year, Gabriella has been organising events and writing essays for her project ‘[Cognitive Sensations](https://cognitivesensations.com/)’ which focuses on the neurological and psychological effects of regular technology use and aims to spark discussions about these issues between artists, scientists and the public.
