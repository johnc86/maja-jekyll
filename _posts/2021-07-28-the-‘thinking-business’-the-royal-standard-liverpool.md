Collaboration is defined as the action of ‘working with someone to produce something’. The current exhibition, 'The thinking-business’, at The Royal Standard ponders this matter on multiple levels through the works of Paloma Proudfoot and Rebecca Ounstead. Collaboration is explored as a tool of production and the artists’ respective techniques while focusing on the development of friendships outside of their professional lives.
