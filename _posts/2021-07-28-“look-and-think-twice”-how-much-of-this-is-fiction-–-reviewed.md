While I’m usually apprehensive about using the phrase “post-anything”, FACT’s current exhibition [How much of this is fiction.](http://www.fact.co.uk/projects/how-much-of-this-is-fiction.aspx) really does home-in on the all-pervasive doubt surrounding our absorption of new, and post-truth, information. It comes post-Brexit referendum and post-Trump election, without ever addressing either of these events directly. While they may be alluded to in the mind of the viewer, the show focuses on exposing the techniques used within popular media to manoeuvre the audience’s thoughts onto a certain path. The artworks pose as dystopian alternatives to actual events, and we get the fun job of applying them to our own experiences of truth.
