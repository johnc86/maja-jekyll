Every few weeks I experience an unbearable, unexplained urge to taste sour things. Sour sweets are too sweet so I put lemon juice on everything, suck on limes when working and carry emergency slices around with me wrapped in foil, in case it strikes again. Nothing is sour enough, nothing can fully satiate the need*.* It feels like I canâ€™t take in a full breath until the acid hits my tongue.
