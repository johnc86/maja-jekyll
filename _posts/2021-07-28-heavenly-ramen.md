The best ramen I have ever had was in Amsterdam. Thick silky noodles, milky-tea-coloured broth, a crispy slice of seaweed. Egg yolks bursting and sliding down chunks of spicy kimchi, like the heavy rain drops sliding down the window panes of that dingy, cosy restaurant. The silence between me and my boyfriend would usually bother me, but at that moment food filled this silence to the brim. My hair was wet from the rain, the steam was warming my chin, the glazed bowl was beautiful and my throat was burning with joy. That first unforgettable mouthful is my happy place.
