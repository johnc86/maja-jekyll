Play is essential in our development. Not unlike animals, as children it is a way for us to prepare for more serious applications of the skills acquired during play. As adults, it is an incredibly effective way for us to test out and approach subjects which would otherwise be difficult to face. Freud theorised that laughter is caused by released inhibitions while Surrealism, Dada and the significance of nonsense in art creation is said to have emerged after the trauma of war to 'tame the savageness of life'. So the question remains â€“ if fun has so much significance, how is it manifested in the art of today?
