Let’s dive right in: Jonathan Baldock is one of those artists who effortlessly manages to marry ideas with a proficiency in his chosen medium that allows him to communicate both clearly and beautifully. His current show ‘Facecrime’ at Liverpool’s Bluecoat Gallery was my first chance to see his work in its clay flesh. I initially encountered the artist at a talk he gave in the same gallery a few years ago – I was completely enamoured with the way he talked about his work: it was accessible, witty, and most importantly, funny.
