I lived in Manchester for years and now come back very often to see my family. It’s one of a few places that feels  like home – there is a familiar warmth, even a cosiness despite its size and continuous rapid growth, bulging out of the old boundaries. When I heard about ‘[Dark Days Luminous Nights](https://manchestercollective.co.uk/luminous)’, the product of a collaboration between [Manchester Collective](https://manchestercollective.co.uk/) and local artists Simon Buckley and Blackhaine, I jumped at the chance to see the city I know so well from a fresh, audio-visual perspective.
