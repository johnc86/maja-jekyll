*I have been planning to chat with the Convenience Gallery team for a few months now, I suppose you could say it took a pandemic for us to finally arrange a Zoom call. We talked on a beautiful, sunny afternoon and the timing was actually perfect. We all left uplifted: by the sight of each other in the little rectangles on our screens; by talking about art and creativity; and briefly looking forward to the future, when we will hopefully be able to have a glass of wine together in the same room.*
